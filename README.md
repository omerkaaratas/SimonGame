Simon Game with JavaScript


This is a digital implementation of the classic memory game "Simon". In this game, the computer will randomly select a sequence of colors, and the player must repeat that sequence back to the computer. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more difficult to remember.

How to Play
Press the any button to begin a new game.
The computer will flash a sequence of colors.
Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order.
If you get the sequence correct, the computer will add another color to the sequence and repeat the pattern.
If you make a mistake, the game is over.
